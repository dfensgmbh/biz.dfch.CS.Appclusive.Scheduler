·         others have the right to modify it.

8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
9.    APPLICABLE LAW.
a.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

This limitation applies to

·         anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

·         claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

8. Limited Warranty

Except as specified in Section 1.3.4 (Trial License) Telerik warrants solely that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software. Telerik does not warrant the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Licensee’s failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Telerik. In the event of a breach of warranty, Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and Telerik’s sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee’s sole remedy and Telerik’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is only valid if Telerik receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8, TELERIK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Telerik be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Telerik’s entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such damages, or in the case of a Trial License, shall not exceed $5, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable. Telerik is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or any material linked through such content. In addition, Telerik is not responsible for Licensee’s use of the Software in violation of applicable laws or any third party’s property rights. Any data included in the Software upon shipment from Telerik is for testing use only and Telerik hereby disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom. The extent of Telerik’s liability for the limited warranty section shall be as set forth therein.

10. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Telerik and its resellers from and against any and all claims, lawsuits and proceedings (collectively “Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney's fees), judgments, damages and other liabilities resulting from such Claims, that arise or result from Your use or misuse of the Software.

11. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that: (i) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party has disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party. Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Software as confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate, or distribute such materials to any third party without Telerik’s prior written permission. Each party’s obligations under this Section 11 shall apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code shall survive in perpetuity and (ii) trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.

12. Governing Law

This License will be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. If any dispute, controversy, or claim cannot be resolved by a good faith discussion between the parties, then it shall be submitted for resolution to a state or Federal court or competent jurisdiction in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and the parties hereby agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such court. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act and the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement. Failure of a party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision.

13. Entire Agreement

This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous communications regarding the subject matter hereof. Use of any purchase order or other Licensee document in connection herewith shall be for administrative convenience only and all terms and conditions stated therein shall be void and of no effect. The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement shall prevail over any inconsistent provisions in any form or other paper submitted by Licensee.

14. No Assignment

You may not assign, sublicense, sub-contract, or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or any rights or obligations under it, without Telerik’s prior written consent.

15. Survival

Any provisions of the Agreement containing license restrictions, warranties and warranty disclaimers, confidentiality obligations, limitations of liability and/or indemnity terms, and any provision of the Agreement which, by its nature, is intended to survive shall remain in effect following any termination or expiration of the Agreement.

16. Severability

If a particular provision of this Agreement is terminated or held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions.

17. Force Majeure 

Neither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement if failure or delay in performance is caused by an act of God, fire, flood, severe weather conditions, material shortage or unavailability of transportation, government ordinance, laws, regulations or restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of such party.

18. Export Classifications

You expressly agree not to export or re-export Telerik Software or Your Integrated Product to any country, person, entity or end user subject to U.S. export restrictions.

Except as specified in Section 1.3.4 (Trial License) Telerik warrants solely that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software.

In the event of a breach of warranty, Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and Telerik’s sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee’s sole remedy and Telerik’s maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only.

In any case, Telerik’s entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such damages, or in the case of a Trial License, shall not exceed $5, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.

11. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement.

Further, either party may disclose confidential information of the other party as required by governmental or judicial order, provided such party gives the other party prompt written notice prior to such disclosure and complies with any protective order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall treat any source code for the Software as confidential information and shall not disclose, disseminate, or distribute such materials to any third party without Telerik’s prior written permission. Each party’s obligations under this Section 11 shall apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that (i) obligations with respect to source code shall survive in perpetuity and (ii) trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.

12. Governing Law

This License will be governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof.
